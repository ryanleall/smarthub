# Checkbox

Checkboxes are a square box that can be activated or deactivated (or somewhere in between), and
allow users to select one or more options from a list of choices, or confirm an action.

Similar to, but distinct from, radio buttons and toggle switches. Unlike radio buttons, checkboxes
permit for multiple options to be selected. Unlike toggle switches, checkboxes are not designed to
be used for on/off actions.
